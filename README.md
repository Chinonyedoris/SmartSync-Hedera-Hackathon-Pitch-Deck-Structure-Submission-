# SmartSync – A Unified Voice Assistant for Smart TVs & Smart Home Devices

**Final Project – TechyJaunt UI/UX Design Cohort 2025**  
**Team: Group 8**

## 📌 Project Overview
SmartSync (also known as **Unify**) is a smart home control app designed to bring all your devices under one seamless interface. It solves the problem of fragmentation in smart home ecosystems by integrating multiple brands and platforms into a single, user-friendly experience.

## 🎯 Problem
Smart home users often face:
- Multiple apps for different brands
- Poor cross-device automation
- Confusing UX for non-tech-savvy users
- Limited offline/local control

Our goal: **One app to control them all.**

## 👥 Target Audience
- **Age Range:** 30–60
- **Profile:** Homeowners with 3+ smart home devices (lights, thermostats, cameras, TVs, etc.)
- **Pain Points:** Switching between multiple apps, lack of simplicity, privacy concerns.

## 🚀 Our Solution
**SmartSync App** includes:
- **Unified Dashboard** – Control lights, locks, cameras, and TVs from one screen.
- **Scenes & Routines** – Automate actions like “Good Morning” or “Away Mode”.
- **Voice Assistant Integration** – Works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri.
- **Security Dashboard** – Manage device permissions and activity.
- **Compatibility Checker** – Supports Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Wi-Fi devices.

## 📊 Research Process
- **Surveys:** 30+ responses via Google Forms
- **Interviews:** 6 detailed user interviews
- **Key Insight:** Users use 3–4 apps to manage daily routines.
    Older users struggle with complicated interfaces.

## 📊 Competitive Analysis
-Studied existing apps: Google Home, Apple HomeKit, Hubitat, Aqara Home, Wemo App, TP-Link Kasa.
Gaps identified:
-No true all-in-one solution.
-Weak offline/local automation.
-Poor UX for non-tech-savvy users.
-Lack of transparency on device permissions.

## 👤 User Persona – Grace, 54
**Tech Level:** Cautious but owns 6 smart devices.
**Goals:** Peace of mind, simple UI, reliable automation.

💡 Ideation & Tools
**Brainstorming:** FigJam, Affinity Mapping.
**HMW Questions:** Framed problem-solving.
**Wireframes:** Sketched flows for Login, Onboarding, Unified Control Panel, Scene Creation, Device Insights.
